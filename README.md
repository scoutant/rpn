Very easy to use **RPN Calculator** for Android device. Neat and simple, yet powerful for everyday use. 

Do remember that with __Reverse Polish Notation__ you first type the numbers and you finish with the operator. See https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reverse_Polish_notation.

For example, _how many hour in a week?_ :

24 7 *


You may appreciate the Undo feature.
